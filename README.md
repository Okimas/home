# My homepage source

A simple React App hosted on GitHub: [link](https://okimas.github.io/home/).

## Details

You can see in the code that all the content of page come from a object `staticData.`. That's because I intend to create a MERN project based on this app that loads content from MongoDB, has login and routes requests with nodeJS/express. Simple but a complete template to start.
